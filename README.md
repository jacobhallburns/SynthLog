## Project Decisions
  ### GUI Interface Decision
  Contributor: Jacob Hall-Burns<br/>
  Date: 9/10/2024<br/>
  While searching for a good UI tool to use for the group project, I stumbled across a video: [Build A Modern Python GUI Project | Step by Step Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI9LXzo0UY0).<br/>
  This video introduced me to the Python GUI tools:<br/>
	  [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) - Part of the Python standard library.<br/>
	  [CustomTkinter](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/) - Allows for a more modern GUI design based on Tkinter.<br/>
